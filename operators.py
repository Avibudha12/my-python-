# # arthmetic operators is the boss here 
# #i can do anything with these operators 
# #variables 
# x = 20
# y = 10

# #addition 
# print(x + y)

# #substraction 
# print(x - y)

# #multiplication 
# print(x*y)

# #division 
# print(x/y)

# # modulus
# print(x%y)

# #exponentation
# print(x**y)

# #floor division 
# print(x//y)


#assignment operators 
#assign 
#add and assign
# x += 6
# print("x += 5 ->", x)
# subtract and assign
# multiply and assign 
# divide and assign
# modulus and assign 
# expo and assign



# # comparisn operators 
# num1 = 23

#logical operators 

# a = True

# identity operators are used to compare the object, not if they are equal , but if they are actually the samea object, with the same memory allocation 

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = a
# c = [1, 2, 3]
# print( a is b ) # true, because both a and b point tpo the same object 
# print(a is c)
# print(b is c)



 #sequence  operators
